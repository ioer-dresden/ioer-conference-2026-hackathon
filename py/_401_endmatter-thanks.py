# # Thank You!
#
# This collaborative environment and the **Conference Hack** format were made possible by the support of the **4th IOER Conference "Space & Transformation"** organization team and the **IOER Research Data Centre (IOER FDZ)**.
#
# We would like to thank **Nicolaas Bongaerts** for contributing the visual identity and the header graphic for this project.
#
# ### Open Science & Data
#
# Open science requires an open ecosystem. One that is accessible, where data is openly shared and not hidden behind complex terms of use or restrictive licenses.
#
# We explicitly thank the colleagues at the [IOER Monitor of Settlement and Open Space Development](https://www.ioer-monitor.de/) for providing the comprehensive data basis and the API that powers some of the workflows in this book. Their work enables us to analyze spatial trends in Germany with high precision.
#
# We also acknowledge the **Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)** and the **LAND - Lebendiger Atlas der Natur Deutschlands** initiative, whose open data interfaces serve as excellent examples for interdisciplinary data integration.
#
# ### To the Community
#
# Most importantly, we thank **you**, the participants of the Hackathon. Your code, your ideas, and your contributions turn this technical framework into a living artifact of the conference.
#
# We hope that this Jupyter Book is not a static output, but remains a resource for the community, evolving even after the conference concludes.
#
# Please [let us know](mailto:fdz@ioer.de) what you think of this initiative. If you are inspired to contribute further, please check the [Contributing section](../CONTRIBUTING).
